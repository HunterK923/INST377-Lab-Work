      ## Retrieving information from an API
        The Fetch API is relatively new,
        and is much more convenient than previous data handling methods.
        Here we make a basic GET request to the server using the Fetch method
        to send a request to the routes defined in /server/routes/foodServiceRoutes.js

      // this is a basic GET request
      // It does not include any of your form values, though
    */
    const fetchQuery = new URLSearchParams(formProps);
    const results = await fetch(`/api/foodServicePG?${fetchQuery}`);

    // This changes the response from the GET into data we can use - an "object"
    const arrayFromJson = await results.json();
    console.table(arrayFromJson.data); // this is called "dot notation"
    // arrayFromJson.data - we're accessing a key called 'data' on the returned object
    // it initially contains all 1,000 records from your request
  });
}

/*
  This adds an event listener that fires our main event only once our page elements have loaded
  The use of the async keyword means we can "await" events before continuing in our scripts
  In this case, we load some data when the form has submitted
